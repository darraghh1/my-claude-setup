## Verdict

**Template Score:** 11/11
**Ready:** Yes

This plan correctly adapts the template to a workflow automation refactor context. The Project Framework Alignment section appropriately defines patterns for skill modification rather than application code. Security Requirements are adapted to workflow security (sandboxing, prompt injection) rather than application security (RLS, auth). All sections are complete and well-structured.
